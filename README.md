## Static Website

A very simple static website

## Habilities

### CSS

Use CSS Modules with [next-css](https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-css) with PostCSS Plugins

### HTML

Use ReactJS to create UI Components, build your own components

### JS

Create isolated JavaScript functions which will help you test your code.

## Development

Just run `yarn dev`

## Production

You can use `yarn export` to generate static files into the `./out` folder.

You can also use `yarn start` to start a nodejs process with optimized files, in this repo I'll focus on the output of the `yarn export` command.

## Production Preview

Run `yarn preview` to generate all the optmized static files and serve it under `http://localhost:5000`

## i18n URLs

Currently I'm working on this url approach

```
/
/en
/es

/blog
/es/blog
/en/blog

/application
/en/application
/es/application
```
